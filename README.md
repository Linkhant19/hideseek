# hideseek

This is a hide and seek card game I came up with in a dream, and I really wanted to make it into an actual game, so here we are. 

I am going to try to implement multiple roles and various cards with different roles. 

**Hider Classes: **
Golem: Golem excels in defending himself against the Seeker by healing or hiding amongst the crumbled rocks. 
Deck = Normal x 3, Slam! x 3, Healing Gem x 2

Dream Damsel: Dream Damsel bends dreams into her will, allowing her to escape through daydreams or trapping her opponent in terrifying nightmares.
Deck = Normal x 3, Nightmare x 3, Daydream x 2


**Seeker Classes: **


**Cards Details: **

1. Normal : Normal card with no abilities. 

2. Slam! : 

3. Healing Gem : Heal 1 health. Heal none if health is at max. 

4. Nightmare : For the next turn, Seeker's deck will be modified with 10% of Seek card and 90% chance of Normal card. 

5. Daydream : Hides inside a daydream. No cards will have effect on you this turn.
