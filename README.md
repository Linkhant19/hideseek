# hideseek

This is a hide and seek card game I came up with in a dream, and I really wanted to make it into an actual game, so here we are. 
This project is being actively worked on by Lin Khant Ko and Kyle Yung.

We are going to try to implement multiple roles and various cards with different roles. 

**Hider Classes: **

Golem: Golem excels in defending himself against the Seeker by healing or hiding amongst the crumbled rocks. 
Deck = Normal x 3, Slam! x 3, Healing Gem x 2

Dream Damsel: Dream Damsel bends dreams into her will, allowing her to escape through daydreams or trapping her opponent in terrifying nightmares.
Deck = Normal x 3, Nightmare x 3, Daydream x 2

Sight: Sight sees all through his blindfold, allowing him to make strategic moves and counter the seeker accordingly.
Deck = Normal x 3, I See You x 3, Third Eye x 2


**Seeker Classes: **

Death:
